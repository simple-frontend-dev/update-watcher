# Update Watcher Project Rules

## Project Context

This is an update-watcher project that automates package updates across repositories. It consists of:

- `packages/frontend-updates-runner`: Creates PRs to update frontend packages

## Coding Style & Preferences

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Prefer async/await over promises
- Use descriptive variable and function names

## Update File Format

When creating update files in `packages/frontend-updates-runner/updates/`:

- Use the format `packageName@version.md`
- Include key changes with bold headers but not in markdown headers
- Be concise but comprehensive
- Include migration notes when relevant
- Link to official documentation/changelogs
- Do not use emojis

## Git Workflow

- Commit update files with format: `trigger-frontend-updates:packageName@version`
- Stage files before committing
- Use descriptive commit messages

## Communication Style

- Be direct and actionable
- Provide clear next steps
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Use bullet points for lists of changes
- Keep responses focused on the task at hand

## Information Accuracy

- **Never fabricate or guess information** - only use verified facts
- When creating update files, only include information from official sources
- If official documentation/release notes don't exist yet, be transparent about this
- Link to actual, existing resources rather than hypothetical ones
- When uncertain about details, err on the side of caution and note what's unknown
